# ðŸš€ Font Subsetter

A plugin (likely compatible with your build tool) allowing you to remove unused glyphs from your output font files to improve page-load and time-to-first-byte.

Uses [`glyphhanger`](https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger) under the hood but with the added functionality of overwriting the build output fonts, rather than creating new ones (and having to create links to/stylesheets for them).

## Installation

[`glyphhanger`](https://github.com/zachleat/glyphhanger) is also required as a peer dependency:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @ernxst/subfont glyphhanger

```

```bash
yarn add -D @ernxst/subfont glyphhanger
```

```bash
pnpm i -D @ernxst/subfont glyphhanger
```

## Usage

Note that this integration only works for static builds, it does nothing (rather than erroring) when SSR is enabled.

You may get unexpected results when using this plugin with dynamically generated content.
